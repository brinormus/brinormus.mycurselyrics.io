        I watched you walk away<br>
        Hopeless, with nothing to say<br>
        I strained my eyes<br>
        Hoping to see you again<br>
        <br>
        This is my curse!(the longing)<br>
        This is my curse!(time)<br>
        This is my curse!(the yearning)<br>
        This is my curse<br>
        <br>
        There is love, burning to find you<br>
        Will you wait for me?<br>
        Will you be there?!<br>
        <br>
        Your silence haunts me<br>
        But still I hunger for you<br>
        <br>
        This is my curse!(the longing)<br>
        This is my curse!(time)<br>
        This is my curse!(the needing)<br>
        This is my curse<br>
        <br>
        There is love, burning to find you<br>
        Will you wait for me?<br>
        <br>
        And still I want<br>
        And still I wait<br>
        But still I wait...<br>
        To see you again!<br>
        <br>
        Dying! Inside! These! Walls![2x]<br>
        And I see your face, in these tears<br>
        In these tears...<br>
        And I see your face!<br>
        <br>
        There is love[8x]
